The idea behind this repo is pretty simple. Reproduce a few of the charts from the examples in [Python Graph Gallery](https://python-graph-gallery.com/) with Julia, mainly graphs from [this archive](https://python-graph-gallery.com/best-python-chart-examples/). Maybe a few reproducible tricks can be extracted from this work for a later day. None of the graphs here are my original work, I'll be crediting the authors with each graph
